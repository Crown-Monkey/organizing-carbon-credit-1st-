<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](crown-monkey.com)

Sustainability is the most important word in today’s world, so is there any way to make the world greener. Carbon emissions is the talk of the town today with every countries trying to build a way of emitting less carbons in the near future. As every country is allowed to emit certain tonnes of carbon hence carbon credit becomes more important. As some countries still don’t follow their maximum cap of emitting carbon, here comes the role of bringing transparency in carbon credits so as to ensure the countries emitting less than their maximum cap of credits should be able to trade it. But as the developed countries have more emission levels so they try to manipulate with the data hence bringing unreliability to the carbon credits. So how can we bring a system that is transparent and can calculate the carbon credits in an automated way and can maintain with Paris Climate Agreement Goal of offsetting carbon?

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


### SOLUTION 

A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas. In other words, it is the permit that each country or company has to emit the given amount of greenhouse gases. In today’s world removal of carbon has become a necessity so, we will try to achieve it by proper management of carbon. Right now calculation is done through gathering of manual data but it is not trustworthy and can be tampered so here the comes the role of Blockchain. Here we will try to create a blockchain platform which will allow high emitting organizations to monitor their carbon footprints and meet their quotas by buying carbon credits from low emitters. Therefore, it will create transparency in the system and make it easier to track and report reduction emissions. In climate policy making, transparent measurement, reporting and verification of climate action is important. It enables policymakers to understand where they need to incentivize greenhouse gas emission reductions while being confident that they comply with the requirements set in its standards. ​



### Built With

The main frameworks we will be using are:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/) - Work under process

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## PROJECT FEATURES - EY Expected Outputs & Constructions

### Configure and set up a network where multiple organizations, industry partners and vetting agencies can join and perform their data gathering transactions

<p align="center"><img width="500px" src="https://i.imgur.com/5sqZQgJ.png"></p>

### The participating industries should be able to record their day-to-day transactions and vetting agencies should be able to transparently review them

<p align="center"><img width="500px" src="https://i.imgur.com/kuCjaE0.png"></p>

### The application should be capable calculating carbon credit in a parameterized and configurable manner

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap - FEEDBACK WORKING ON

- [x] Organizations should be able to use Blockchain smart contracts for generating carbon credit certificates
- [x] Vetting agencies should be able to view of the carbon credit certificates possessed by each organization
- [ ] Organizations should be able to share their certificates with other organizations through the blockchain to fulfil their carbon credit requirements
- [ ] Automate carbon credit consumptions on the basis of product other
- [ ] Implementing on Ethereum Blockchain
